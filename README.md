# What is this project?

This is a collection of preferred practices for web development at Rocket Insights. It comes from our collective experience working on software projects for many, many clients.

Let‚Äôs start by talking about what this project _is not_:

_This is not a list of rules you must follow when working on a development project at Rocket._

You're an adult. And we hired you to be part of Rocket because we think you're a good developer.

_This is not meant to be an end all be all documentation of everything we do and everything we believe._

The world changes, especially the tech world. More importantly, each client and project has its own subtleties and needs. The chances of even _being able to follow one set of rules_ for any given project is pretty much zero.

So, what is this project for then?

It‚Äôs to give Rocket developers a launching off point (see what we did there? üòÅ).

It‚Äôs to give Rocket developers ideas of where to start.

It‚Äôs to answer the question: ‚ÄúHow do we usually do web development at Rocket?‚Äù

It's also to share with clients and prospective developer hires so they can get a flavor of how we do things here.

Finally, it's meant to be flexible as technology changes and our practices change over time. It's a living document, meant to be contributed to by everyone at Rocket. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details if you see something that's off or that you think needs to be added.
