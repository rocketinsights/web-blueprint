# Javascript/ECMAScript Suggested Practices

- Consider the use of TypeScript over regular Javascript. While this is a _hotly contested topic_ at Rocket, the idea should be considered because many of us have found that type safety leaves our clients with a more maintainable codebase.
- If you don't use TypeScript prefer using at least ES6 syntax and Babel if necessary
- `TODO` what else?
